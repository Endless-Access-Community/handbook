# Community Handbook

{{ site.description }}
{: .fs-6 }

{: .warning }
>This handbook, much like the community itself, is in its early stages. We're actively building things out, and nothing here should be considered "final." Feel free to [file an issue] if you notice a mistake or feel like something is missing!

Welcome to a community where peer-to-peer mentorship, feedback, and shared learning are the norm. Together we'll build not just skills, but confidence, friendships, and portfolios.

## Who is "Endless Access?"

_Endless Access_ is a nonprofit that believes every learner deserves the chance to shape the worldâ€”not just navigate it. We open doors to digital creativity by combining access, learning, and community in a powerful loop where learners become creators, contributors, and confident innovators. To learn more, visit [our website][Endless Access].
 
{: .note }
>Endless Access is currently undergoing a rename from "Endless OS Foundation" to better reflect our mission; for simplicity, we'll consistently use the new name in this documentation.

The _Endless Access community_ is the global game-making and learning community we're building around our programs. It includes Endless Access staff as well as learners and educators from around the world.
