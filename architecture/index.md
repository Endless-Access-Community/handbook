# Community Architecture

To enable safe participation from learners aged 13–17 as well as adults, we utilize a tiered community structure. Regardless of tier, all community spaces are heavily moderated. In all cases, everyone in the community **can**:
- See other users’ chosen public usernames/display names (e.g. Discord username, GitHub profile)
- See other user’s publicly-shared content, such as contributions on GitHub

And **cannot**:
- Chat 1:1, e.g. via direct messages
- Interact in unmoderated spaces
