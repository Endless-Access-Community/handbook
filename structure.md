# Community Structure

To ensure safe participation for all learners, educators, and contributors, we utilize a tiered community structure. Regardless of tier, all community spaces are heavily moderated, and **all community members must abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Endless-Access-Community/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

Regardless of tier, everyone in the community **can** see other members':
- Chosen public usernames/display names (e.g. Discord username, GitHub profile)
- Publicly-shared content, such as contributions on GitHub

And **cannot**:
- Chat 1:1, e.g. via direct messages
- Interact in unmoderated spaces

## Tiers
