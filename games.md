## Threadbare
{: .d-inline-block }

Coming Soon
{:.label .label-yellow }

A whimsical journey of restoration where stories weave the fabric of a forgotten world back together. You are a newly summoned Storyweaver, heir to the First Storytellers, called to reclaim the worldâ€™s lost stories and restore the Weave.

Threadbare is being used in select learning programs as a scaffolded learning experience. Learners create non-canon StoryQuests that live alongside the canon narrative. In the future, contributors will be able to contribute canon LoreQuests to the core narrative of Threadbare.

## Candy Collective

Platformer that embodies simplicity, is a little unconventional, and includes a touch of harshness with its visual design and gameplay.

Based on [Candy Wrapper](https://github.com/HarmonyHoney/CandyWrapper), Candy Collective adds _community worlds_ where learners contribute their own collection of levels to experiment with level design and difficulty progression. Each community world can reuse the Candy Wrapper assets and mechanics, or implement their own for a truly unique experience within the constraints of the deceptively simple Candy Wrapper engine.
