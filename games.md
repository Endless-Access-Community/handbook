## Candy Collective

Platformer that embodies simplicity, is a little unconventional, and includes a touch of harshness with its visual design and gameplay.

Based on [Candy Wrapper](https://github.com/HarmonyHoney/CandyWrapper), Candy Collective adds _community worlds_ where learners contribute their own collection of levels to experiment with level design and difficulty progression. Each community world can reuse the Candy Wrapper assets and mechanics, or implement their own for a truly unique experience within the constraints of the deceptively simple Candy Wrapper engine.
