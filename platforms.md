# Community Platforms

The community exists across a few different platforms for different uses:

Platform  | Purpose   | Details
:-------- | :-------- | :----------
[Discord] | People    | Real-time chat; like a shared lab where we can work together and help one another
[GitHub]  | Projects  | Code, assets, and task tracking; canonical documentation of decisions and outcomes
[Studio]  | Portfolio | Showcase learning progress, skills, and achievements i.e. with badges

## Discord

Anyone can join the [Endless Access Discord][Discord], but are considered [Newcomers]({{% link structure.md %}}#newcomers) by defaultâ€”meaning mostly read-only access until manually assigned a [Verified]({{% link structure.md %}}#verified) role. Use the `#introductions` channel to share a bit about yourself, and a moderator may manually assign you a role for wider access.

### Invite Links

If you have a specific invite link, e.g. because you're participating in a partner learning program, joining via that link will assign the correct roles. If you accidentally joined via the wrong link, you can let Endless Staff know using the `#help` channel.

### Getting Help

You can always contact a moderator or Endless Access staff using the `#help` channel in Discord.
