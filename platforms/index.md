[Discord] | People    | Real-time chat; like a shared lab where we can work together and help one another
[GitHub]  | Projects  | Code, assets, and task tracking; canonical documentation of decisions and outcomes
[Studio]  | Portfolio | Showcase learning progress, skills, and achievements i.e. with badges
