Discord is a platform where communities create and manage their own dedicated spaces, called “servers.” Endless Access runs a game-making server that is used for communication during learning programs as well as connecting with a wider game-making community.

## Get Discord

Discord can be used in a web browser or as an app on desktop and mobile devices. **Visit [discord.com/download](https://discord.com/download) to download the app or open it in your browser.** If you don’t have an account, you can create one at [discord.com/register](https://discord.com/register) or in the app.

## Join the Endless Access Server

**To join the server as part of a learning program, use the unique invite link provided by your instructor or institution.** Do not share your invite link outside of your program.

Joining via a program invite link will give you the correct roles and access to your private program category. After you agree to the server rules, you’ll see a welcome channel where you can select additional roles such as a group number.

Selecting your role will give you access to a channel where you can discuss the program, ask questions, and interact with your instructor, mentors, and fellow learners. If you accidentally choose the wrong role, you can always tap it again to unselect it, then choose the correct one.

## Set Your Server Nickname

It’s important for your instructor and mentors to be able to recognize you between the learning program sessions and in Discord. To help them out, **use the Per-server Profile feature to set a recognizable nickname:**

1. Right-click the **server icon** (the Endless logo in the sidebar)
2. Select **Edit Per-server Profile**
3. Type your name under **Server Nickname**

Alternatively, you can set your nickname under **User Settings** → **Profiles** → **Per-server Profiles**.

## Code of Conduct

All community members are expected to follow the [Endless Access Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Endless-Access-Community/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is strictly enforced. For example: be kind and respectful, don’t harass or share inappropriate content.

Be sure to read the full Code of Conduct for more detail and examples, and always keep it in mind when chatting in the community. Failure to do so could result in your removal from the Discord server.

## Stay Organized with Threads

Chatting in your group channel with many other learners can get messy if there’s a lot happening. Once you start working with a team, **you may want to create a public “thread”** in your group’s channel as a dedicated space to discuss your work. For example, you can create a thread named after your StoryQuest, then use that thread to coordinate among yourselves.

Recently-used threads appear in the sidebar, and all threads are accessible from the **Threads** menu near the search bar for the channel.

## Community

Within the Endless Access Discord server you’ll also get access to the _Verified_ category. These are community channels where you’re invited to hang out and discuss anything related to game-making with **the wider community outside of your specific learning program**. Keep an eye out for polls, videos, and other resources shared in the community.

The _Threadbare_ category and _#announcements_ channel are also great places to keep up with what’s happening across the Endless Access community.
