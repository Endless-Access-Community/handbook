>**This guide is intended for mentors** or engagement agents of a learning program. Learners, see [Discord for Learners].

# {{ page.title }}

This is a supplement to [Discord for Learners]; please review that guide as it contains helpful information that learners may ask you about. Similar to learners, please **join the Discord server using the program invite link** and **set a per-server nickname** to ensure Endless Staff can identify you.

## Roles & Permissions

All program participants (including learners, mentors, and engagement agents) will receive the program-specific role in Discord which grants access to the private program category. **You will also be assigned a _Mentor_ or _Engagement Agent_ role by Endless Access staff** which enables moderation permissions, including the ability to delete or pin messages.

_Instructors_ and _Mentors_ appear above other members in member lists. **_Endless Staff_ are highlighted in purple**, include the Endless logo after their name, and appear at the very top of member lists.

You can review anyoneâ€™s roles by selecting their user avatar or name.

If you or a learner is lacking a specific role, please use the _#help_ channel to open a ticket with Endless Access staff.

## Model Positive Behavior

As a mentor or engagement agent, learners and community members will look to you to set the tone and expectations around conduct. **Always model inclusive, encouraging behavior** and avoid sarcasm or insider language that may exclude some learners.

## Code of Conduct

All community members are expected to follow the [Endless Access Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Endless-Access-Community/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is strictly enforced.

If you observe a violation:

1. **Mitigate** immediate harm (e.g. delete any harmful messages)

2. If appropriate, **issue a warning** to the learner

3. **Report** all incidents to Endless Access staff via the private _#mods_ channel

## Channels

Programs use a private category with a channel for each learner group. For reference, other relevant categories and channels are:

- **#announcements**: announcements from Endless Access focused on game making  
- **#help**: self-service flow for opening a ticket with Endless Access staff  
- **Verified**: discussion of topics outside of the program itself  
- **Threadbare**: follow along with development of our open source game
