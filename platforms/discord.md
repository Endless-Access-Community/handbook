# {{ page.title }}

Discord is a platform where communities create and manage their own dedicated spaces, called “servers.” Endless Access runs a game-making server that is used for communication during learning programs as well as connecting with the wider game-making community.

<span class="fs-5 d-block text-center">
[Discord for Learners]{: .btn .mx-2 .my-2 }
[Discord for Mentors]{: .btn .mx-2 .my-2 }
</span>

If neither of the above apply, you may join the Discord server using the [public invite link]. However, **you'll be considered a [Newcomer]({% link structure.md %}#newcomers) by default**—meaning mostly read-only access until manually assigned a [Verified]({% link structure.md %}#verified) role.

If you're joining outside of a learning program, be sure to use the _#introductions_ channel to share a bit about yourself and a moderator may manually assign you a role for wider access.
